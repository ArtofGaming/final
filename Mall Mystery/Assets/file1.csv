Intercom,Due to unfortunate circumstances all current mall shoppers are asked to stay until the conclusion of the investigation.
Intercom,Listen up folks there has been a murder. Any attempt to leave will be seen as interfering with a police investigation. So find something to occupy your time questioning will take a few hours.
Random Shopper,Hours?! I bet I could solve the mystery in an hour!
Lucy,...Actually that's a good idea. I think I'll do just that.
Tutorial,"Hunt the mall for clues and when you're ready head to the center room to lock in your answer. You can guess at any time, but you'll get more points by doing a thorough investigation."
Chett,"Since we have all this extra time, I might as well watch another movie."
Chett,I wasn't feeling work today so I dipped from my shift to watch a movie instead. Since it ended at 6 it was almost like I had worked the 4:45 shift I was scheduled for.
Lucy,I found a wallet that belongs to Juliette Carter. I got it from Ryan in the video store. I think it has blood on it. Gross.
Ryan,Since no one's lookin-
Lucy,What are you doing?
Ryan,EEP! No-nothing.
Lucy,I bet the employees would be pretty interested in what's in your pocket
Ryan,"No, I can't go to mall jail again. It's boring as heck and the mall cop just stares me down the whole time."
Lucy,Tell me where you've been and it'll be our little secret.
Ryan,Fine. Some friends and I uh...letting out our creative sides at the playground and the mall cop starting chasing us. I hung out around the back of JC's and found some guy throwing out a bunch of stuff around 5. He even threw out this wallet. With cash!
Lucy,The wallet that's on the floor?
Ryan,Useless without the cash.
Lucy, It's a security badge that says Paul Bart.
Paul,Darn kids...
Lucy,What's wrong?
Paul,"Spent all day cleaning paint, lost my badge chasing around kids and now II have to sit tight during a murder investigation! Now don't get me wrong, I'm sad someone's dead I just- It's been a long day."
Lucy,Is that where you got that rip on your shirt?
Paul,"Yeah, I must've snagged myself somewhere while chasing that group of brats."
Lucy,It's a lip gloss from the s.e.l.f. brand.
Risa,This sucks! I've already been here for hours!
Lucy,Isn't that the point of going to the mall?
Risa,"Well yeah, but my mom forgot me so I had to wait around all day. And even after all this time, I still can't find my lip gloss! This is the worst day ever!"
Glenn,Where is that blasted thing?
Lucy,What are you looking for?
Glenn,I just bought myself a new watch and already lost it!
Glenn,It must've gotten lost in the panic after I reported that poor woman's body.
Glenn,Guess I'll have to go back to the sports store to get another.
Lucy,I found a very bloody and badly bent hanger. What happened here?
Lucy,"I found an outline of a body and a small summary. The victim was Juliette Carter, wife of the JC's owner. JC's must be the place where she died. How ironic."
Lucy,I found a watch. It looks brand new.
Jared,"Since we're all stuck here I guess I can make a few sales. What can I do for you, young lady"
Lucy,A murder just happened in your store. I have a few questions.
Jared,"Ah yes, my wife. It was her time I suppose, I guess she was never destined to take over the store."
Jared,Anyway I lots things to do...mourning and such.
Tutorial,Fill in the blanks with who did it and with what.
